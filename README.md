# K&R &ndash; *The C Programming Language* (Exercises)

Exercises from the classic work by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie &ndash;
[_The C Programming Language_] (Second Edition), also known as K&R. In honor of
the authors, the code in this repository is written in [K&R style].

## Running the Programs

A C compiler is required to compile the code before running it. All source code
for these exercises was compiled using [GCC].

For example, here is how to compile and run Exercise 1-1:

```console
$ cd kr/chapter1
$ gcc -ansi exercise1-01.c
$ ./a.out
hello, world
```
